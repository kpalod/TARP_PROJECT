# AUTOMATIC FARE GENERATION SYSTEM FOR PARKING LOTS USING RASPBERRY PI


## PROBLEM STATEMENT
In India, owing to a large population, car sales growth hikes every year. This drives the need for strategizing methods for efficient systems that simplifies the management of these automobiles.
The traditional method of collecting fares often entails distributing slips that detail the entry,
their collection, and the chosen fare at the time of leaving. This process always takes longer
at entry because there are fewer workers and more visitors' cars. Regular users find it to be
quite a task to keep the slips that are thereafter given safe and accessible.
Our project aims to provide an efficient and automatic fare generation system for parking lots that cater to multitudes of cars on a daily basis.
