## *Workflow division*
We will divide the tasks among the team members based on their strong points. However every team member would help other members in their tasks if possible and team members would explain their work to others so that everyone learns the problem better and can help come up with a solution whenever required. 

- *Front-end development:* One team member (Shlok Aggarwal) would be responsible for developing the user interface and ensuring that the tool is easy to use and navigate
- *Data parsing and analysis :* Another team member(Kushagra Palod) would focus on developing the algorithms and models that extract information from resumes and analyze it to provide insights into the job applicants' qualifications.
- *Natural language Processing implementation:* The third team member(Archit Jain) would be responsible for implementing the Natural Language Processing to find the relationship between different entities in a text.

Other tasks such as documentation,paper collection, related work analysis and project design would be contributed by all equally. 

Regular communication and collaboration among the team members will be ensured through GitHub Desktop so that the project progresses smoothly and efficiently.
