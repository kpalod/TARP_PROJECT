## Introduction
A "Smart Resume Analyser" is a tool that automates the process of evaluating and analyzing job applicants' resumes. It is designed to help aspirants to gain skills and save time and effort in the job hunting process by quickly extracting relevant information from resumes and presenting it in an organized and meaningful way.

## *Methodology*
- Data Collection and Data Preprocessing: The application takes a resume as input, either in the form of a PDF or a text document. The application then eliminates any unnecessary information from the resume, including headers, footers, and graphics, and transforms it to plain text. The text is then tokenized into words and sentences, and various fundamental text cleaning operations are carried out, like stop word removal and word stemming. For this we will use PyResparser which is a Python library used for parsing resumes and extracting structured information such as candidate name, email, phone number, education, and work experience. Below is how this library works:
  - Parsing the Resumes: PyResparser takes in a resume which can be in various different formats like pdf, html, txt etc. and converts it into plain text using external libraries such as PyPDF2, docx2txt, and Beautiful Soup.
  - Pre-Processing the text: The resume's plain text is pre-processed using a variety of methods, including sentence and word tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming, to weed out extraneous material and identify crucial keywords.

- Information Extraction: Important data including the candidate's name, email address, phone number, educational background, employment history, and skill set are extracted by the programme using NLP techniques like Named Entity Recognition (NER). 
PyResparser employs NLP methods like Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract structured data from the candidate's resume, including their name, email, phone number, educational background, employment history, and abilities. Spacy library is used by PyResparser for NER.
PyResparser delivers the findings in JSON format, which can be utilised for additional analysis or storage, after the structured data has been extracted.

- Data Analysis and Visualization: The application analyses the retrieved data using statistical approaches to produce insights like a list of the most commonly stated abilities, a summary of work history, and educational background. The application displays the analysis findings as interactive graphs and charts. 
Finally, it can be said that PyResparser is a helpful tool for recruiters, HR specialists, and job portals to automate resume screening and candidate shortlisting since it parses resumes and extracts structured information using a combination of external libraries and NLP techniques.


## *Functionality*
- Resume parsing: The tool can quickly scan and extract key information from resumes, such as education, work experience, skills, and certifications.
- Data analysis: The tool can use algorithms and machine learning models to analyze the extracted data and provide insights into the job applicants' qualifications, -  strengths, and weaknesses.
- Matching: The tool can compare the extracted information with the requirements of the job to identify the best-fit candidates and present them to the employer in a ranked order.
- Reporting: The tool can generate reports that summarize the key findings and provide recommendations on which candidates are the most suitable for the job.

Overall, a smart resume analyser can make it easier and more efficient for the students to evaluate their job prospects.

## *Description About Dataset*
- The Kaggle dataset [Resume Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snehaanbhawal/resume-dataset?resource=download) contains a collection of resumes in PDF format. 
- Here are some details about the dataset:
  - The dataset contains 1,420 resumes in PDF format.
  - The resumes belong to candidates from various fields, such as software engineering, marketing, finance, healthcare, and more
  - The resumes are labeled with the candidate's name and the category of the resume (such as "Software Engineer", "Sales Manager", "Data Analyst", etc.).
- We are using this dataset for various NLP tasks related to resume parsing and analysis, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), Text Classification, Information Extraction, and more. 

## *Tools used*

- Dblp : For finding relevant latest papers as per the scope of the course defined.
- Obsidian : A markdown editor used for editing .md files and creating documentation of the project. 

## *Workflow division*
We will divide the tasks among the team members based on their strong points. However every team member would help other members in their tasks if possible and team members would explain their work to others so that everyone learns the problem better and can help come up with a solution whenever required. 

- *Front-end development:* One team member (Shlok Aggarwal) would be responsible for developing the user interface and ensuring that the tool is easy to use and navigate
- *Data parsing and analysis :* Another team member(Kushagra Palod) would focus on developing the algorithms and models that extract information from resumes and analyze it to provide insights into the job applicants' qualifications.
- *Natural language Processing implementation:* The third team member(Archit Jain) would be responsible for implementing the Natural Language Processing to find the relationship between different entities in a text.

Other tasks such as documentation,paper collection, related work analysis and project design would be contributed by all equally. 

Regular communication and collaboration among the team members will be ensured through GitHub Desktop so that the project progresses smoothly and efficiently.

## Results and Discussions
The resume analyzer project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques, particularly named entity recognition (NER) using the spacy framework in Python. The spacy framework is a powerful and widely used library for NLP tasks. The NER model in the project is trained to recognize and extract entities such as personal details, educational qualifications, work experience, skills, and achievements from the resumes. The accuracy of the NER model is a crucial factor that determines the quality of the extracted information. The spacy framework provides an accuracy report that shows the precision, recall, and F1 score of the model. These metrics are calculated based on the number of true positives, false positives, and false negatives. Based on the presence or absence of specific entities in the extracted information, such as work experience, education, skills,and achievements, the projectâ€™s scoring feature assigns scores. Depending on how crucial an entity is to the job opening, the weights given to each one can be changed. The user is then given feedback based on the scores regarding the professionalism and applicability of their resume to the job posting. The projectâ€™s remarks and tips feature employs a machine learning algorithm that analyses the extracted data and gives the user feedback on how to strengthen their resume. A dataset of resumes and feedback from experienced recruiters are used to train the algorithm. To give the user personalised feedback, it makes use of a variety of NLP techniques, including sentiment analysis and text classification. 

Table below shows an example

| **Resume Name**   | **Resume Score**| **Remarks**                                          |
|-------------------|---------------- | -----------------------------------------------------|
| John Doe.pdf      | 75/100          | Add more quantifiable achievements and skills.       |
| Jane Smith.pdf    | 90/100          | Well-organized and highlights relevant information.  |
| Mark Johnson.pdf  | 65/100          | More focus needed on work experience and education.  |
| Sarah Lee.pdf     | 85/100          | Relevant details on skills and achievements.         |
| Michael Brown.pdf | 70/100          | More focus needed on education and skills.           |

The "Resume Name" column lists the name of the resume file that was analyzed. The "Resume Score" column provides a numerical score out of 100 for each resume, based on the analysis performed by the project. Finally, the "Resume Remarks" column provides concise, professional feedback on each resume, highlighting areas of strength and areas for improvement.

The projectâ€™s ability to provide remarks and tips based on the uploaded resume is a valuable feature for job seekers. It allows them to identify specific areas where they can improve their resume to increase their chances of being hired. The admin side of the project, which stores all resumes and tracks the most commonly used features, provides valuable insights for employers. This can help them identify trends in job applicantsâ€™ resumes and tailor their recruitment strategies accordingly.

## Conclusion
The results have shown that our model can generate a predictive score and categorize the resume uploaded by the candidate. The HireHive project has the potential to be a valuable tool for both job seekers and employers. Its ability to provide feedback and insights based on the uploaded resume can help job seekers improve their chances of being hired, while its tracking and visualization features can help employers optimize their recruitment strategies. One potential limitation of the project is that it relies on NER, which may not accurately capture all relevant information in a resume. Additionally, the toolâ€™s ability to compare resumes to others in its database may be limited by the quality and size of its dataset. However, these limitations could potentially be addressed through continued development and improvement of the tool.
