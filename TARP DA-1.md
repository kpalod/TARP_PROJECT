# Workflow description for collaborative work
● Project launch: The project manager or leader lays out the project's aims, deadlines, and
required resources. They also define roles for team members and allocate them.
● Planning and requirement gathering: We will collaborate to identify the project's
requirements and develop a thorough project plan with deadlines, milestones, and tasks.
For this we will be conducting a literature survey based on the recent papers collected
using dblp.
● Source control setup: To manage the project code, collaborate on changes, and monitor
progress, we will set-up a github repository which will help us collaborate individually and
to save every change which can help us to roll back changes if ever required.
● Development: we plan to divide the task between modules and submit any updated
code to the github source control repository. To automatically create, test, and deploy the
code changes, the team makes use of continuous integration and deployment tools.
● Code reviews: To assure quality and adherence to the project plan and goals, team
members critique one another's code updates. We plan to communicate and resolve any
difficulties or worries using the source control system.
● Testing and problem fixing: To ensure that the code complies with the specifications and
performs as anticipated, the team runs tests. Any faults or problems are noted, given to
the appropriate team members, and fixed.
● Iteration and refinement: Up until the project is finished, the team keeps working on it,
repeating the development, code review, testing, and bug-fixing cycles.
● Project completion: The team conducts a final evaluation of the project and archives all
related materials.

This workflow is adaptable and can be changed as necessary depending on the particular
needs and limitations of the project. Clear communication, teamwork, regular reports on
progress, and reviews to make sure the project stays on track and achieves its objectives are
essential to success.
